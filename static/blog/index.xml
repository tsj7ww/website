The 3 AM Wake-up Call It was 3 AM when my phone buzzed with an urgent alert: our main API endpoint was experiencing unusual latency spikes. But here&amp;rsquo;s the twist - our newly implemented anomaly detection system caught this before any user reported issues. By the time I checked the dashboard, our automated remediation had already scaled up the necessary resources.</description>
