What does the average person think about the United States education system? In general, I think most Americans would believe that they are very competitive when it comes to education. Of the top 10 best universities in the world, 8 can be found in the United States. These statistics, however, unjustly display the underlying issue plaguing the US education system that over time is making Americans less competitive in a growing global economy. For instance, University of California – Berkeley is ranked by US News as the 3rd best university in the world; however, it is also ranked within the top 25 universities with the most international students. This issue extends to other globally competitive universities, such as Columbia, Brown, Georgetown, and many others. This alarming number brings up the issue, maybe our students are not as globally competitive as we initially thought? But why is that?

The US K-12 education system, in contrast to our universities, does not hold up well compared to other nations. Numbers of American students with strong test scores have been in steady decline. A study done by NPR shows that US students are dropping in the ranks in terms of math, reading, and science scores in data collected by the PISA. In math, US students scored 30th of 65 other countries, 23rd in science, and 20th in reading.

Now, one could come to the conclusion that our students are becoming “dumber” with time, however that would be a dismal and nearly unsolvable underlying problem. There is, however, another potential underlying factor that may be causing the evident problem: inadequacies in the US K-12 education system.

The US K-12 education system can be broken down into 2 large parts: the private system and the public system. Unlike private schools, public schools are run exclusively off of government funding, and because of that, must jump through many hoops to ensure that they are still eligible for money. This has led to policy initiatives to change the structure of the traditional public school system in hopes of finding a more efficient manner to deal with public education. One of those initiatives is the charter school system. Charter schools focus on the flexibility of the structure of schools by making charters with the State governments that exempt that schools from agreed upon local and state rules and regulations. This is thought to bring about positive change because it is thought that the amount of restrictions put on standard public schools by the different levels of government forces these schools to become more inefficient.

So what if the problem isn’t the students, but instead the institutions? If our high schools and middle schools aren’t up to par with the rest of the world, maybe that isn’t what we would like to see, but it is certainly more fixable than the alternative problem of dropping intelligence levels.

But how well are the alternatives doing in comparison to the traditional public school system? Are they bringing about a higher quality of education? Should the US government invest more in programs like these?

North Carolina is one of many states to recently push charter schools. Since 2014, 53 new charter schools have opened their doors with a student population growth of over 65%. This makes North Carolina a great place to test the idea that charter schools might perform better than traditional public schools.

And, if that was your original intuition, then you might have been right. Testing the data from 2010 to 2015 in the North Carolina public school system, students in charter schools outperform students in traditional schools on average on all 3 parts of the SAT. In math, charter school students score an average of 72 points higher than traditional school students. That number increases to 86 and 130 for critical reading and writing respectively, with overall scoring over 17% higher on the three part SAT score (scores that add math, critical reading, and writing).

Stopping there, however, wouldn’t do the data its full justice. Overall, SAT scores in North Carolina have been declining significantly.Three part SAT scores have decreased at a rate of 3% for charter school students from 2010 to 2015, whereas that rate was only 2% for traditional schools.

So, what do we do? Maybe we should focus on the higher decreasing score rates and cut funding for charter schools? In my opinion, that would be the wrong decision.

Charter schools do, in the end, get better scores than traditional schools do. More than likely, the decreasing scores can be due to the charter schools experiencing an extraneous factor: a massive increase in students. With the huge influx of students entering the charter school system from 2011 to 2015, charter schools went through costly changes that traditional schools didn’t have to deal with (in fact, traditional schools probably benefited from this outflow of students). This likely contributed to the decreasing scores we saw in charter school over time, as well as the smaller decrease we saw in traditional school scores.

What is my final proposal? I think that we should continue empowering the flexible structure that charter schools provide and fund even more charter schools in hopes of recreating higher scores seen North Carolina and increasing the global competitiveness of American students.
